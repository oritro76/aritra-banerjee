**Version**: 1.11.2

Monefy is a money management tool which allows users to track their expenses and income. Therefore, the main functionality of the app is to calculate total expenses and incomes of the user input data. The app also has a pro version. So, the business goal is to sell the pro version to the user. This goal can be achieved if the main functions of this app are working and a customer has a positive user experience. Also, the cool features of the app are included in the Pro Version. So we need to check that the main functionalities of the app are working correctly and UI is showing in all mobiles as designed. And also a user can avail the PRO features by paying the correct amount. 
So, first of all, we need to check:
 - the application can be installed in all the supported Android versions.
 - the application can be updated without losing user data
 - the main functionalities are working as expected
 - user doesn't have access to pro features
 - design of the app is responsive and looks the same on devices with a different form factors
 - as this app has all the personal expenditure data of a user, testing basic security is also important
 - after upgrading to PRO version, PRO features are working as expected

The test cases are categorized on the basis of different UI components, features and functionalities of the APP
